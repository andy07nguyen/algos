//Without using the .length property that is present on all arrays, determine
//and return the number of values in the given array. If we were to do this on
//a numerical array, we might check to see whether the element at a certain
//numerical index was undefined. Unfortunately, we can't do that here because
//the keys don't have any sort of predictable order or first value.
//
//So, for object { band: "Travis Shredd & the Good Ol' Homeboys", style:
//"Country/Metal/Rap", album: "668: The Neighbor of the Beast" } you should
//return the value 3 because there are three keys in this object: band, style
//and album.
